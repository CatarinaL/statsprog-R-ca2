## CA 2 Instructions
### Programming with R

> You will write a program (R script) which imports, joins and transforms some advertising data. 
Hypothetically this program will run daily on the latest version of the data, so this is not a one-off, discardable analysis script. It should be well documented with comments, and use functions / pipes to make your code as clearly understandable as possible. There are lots of good articles online about how to approach writing good comments. Significant marks are awarded for readability/understandability: see the Rubric for more information.

### Resources

* RStudio development environment 

* Github and Git

* Lecture notes in Brightspace

* [Tidyverse package from CRAN](https://www.tidyverse.org/). In the lab you may need to activate some / all of these individual packages that are part of Tidyverse:

  + library(tibble)
  + library(readr)
  + library(dplyr)
  + library(tidyr)
  + library(magrittr)
  + library(ggplot2)

* [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)



### Dataset
Download a sample data set at this link. This is representative of the data sets that will be analysed daily, although they will be much larger.

***

### Solution 


#### 1. Import
Extract the sample data-set zip file to a folder. Your program does not need to extract the zip file, but it should import the four files without any modification by any other program.



#### 2. Transform
_Impression_ and _click_ data both have date, time and timezone variables. Transform dates and times so that all data that the program outputs is in the UTC time zone.
You must write the logic for this transformation yourself. Using a 3rd party package such as lubridate will be heavily penalised (see Rubric).

You can use existing R functions to parse the elements out of a timestamp e.g. hour or date, however you must write the code that adds/subtracts hours, days etc. 



#### 3. Join
Add all columns from advertisers and campaigns into the _impression_ and _click_ data.



#### 4. Output
After processing the data the program should write two CSV files _impressions_processed.csv_ and _clicks_processed.csv_

```{R, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Install Tidyverse from CRAN
# install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load necessary libraries
library(tibble)
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(magrittr)
#library(ggplot2)

```

* Step 1, importing files with correct column specifications:

```{R, echo=TRUE, include=TRUE}
# Load files into tibbles (using readr functions)
# col_types(): Manually define data type of each column as necessary

advertisers <- read_csv("data/advertiser.csv", 
                        col_types = 
                          cols(
                            ID = col_character() #amend parser guess (double) to string
                            )
                        )

campaigns <- read_csv("data/campaigns.csv" , 
                        col_types = 
                          cols(
                            id = col_character(),
                            advertiser_id = col_character()
                            )
                      )

clicks <- read_tsv("data/clicks.tsv", 
                        col_types = 
                          cols(
                            campaign_id = col_character(),
                            date = col_date(format = "%d/%m/%Y") 
                            #date format needs to be specified because the original doesn't conform to ISO standard
                            )
                   )

impressions <- read_tsv("data/impressions.tsv", 
                        col_types = 
                          cols(
                            campaign_id = col_character(),
                            date = col_date(format = "%d/%m/%Y")
                            )
                        )

```
